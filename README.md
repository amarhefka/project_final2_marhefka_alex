## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this assignment and in the syllabus.

## Comments
There's an error in the Unicorn validator regarding a stray <script> tag after </body>, but it's not actually present in my HTML file. (I did leave a script element before </body>, even though I didn't actually use JavaScript for this assignment; I wasn't sure if I was required to include that anyway.) The error seems to be related to my web host, as I don't receive it when I validate my index.html via file upload.

It may also be worth mentioning that my code linter throws an error for the linear gradients in my CSS file. It doesn't like that they're each on a separate line, but I figured it would be illegible to put them all end-to-end on a single line instead, so it seemed like the lesser of two evils. I hope that's OK!
